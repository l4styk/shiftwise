Use shuffleArray to randomize an array of cards.
Use sortCardsInAscendingOrder to sort an array of cards in ascending order. Cards will be sorted by rank then suit. Aces are low. 

Array of cards should be written as "rank of suit" in lowercase. 
For example:
 `var cardArray = ["ace of spades", "3 of hearts"];`
